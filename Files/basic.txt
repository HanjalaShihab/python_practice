File handling is an important part of any web application
Python has several functions for creating, reading, updating, and deleting files

**The key function to work with files in python is the open() function.
The open() function takes two parameter.(filename and mode)

There are four different methods(modes) for creating a file:
    1.r - read(opens file for reading but error if does not exist)
    2.a - Append(opens files for appending, creates the file if it does not exist)
    3.w - write(Opens a file for writing, creates the file if it does not exist)
    4.x - Create(Create the specified file), return an error if the file exists



    In addition- we can specify the file type:
      1. t - Text.Default
      2. b - Binary.
